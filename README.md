# powersizingcalc

The power-sizing model is an equation that is used to estimate the costs of certain industrial equipment.

The MATLAB code is a user input-based calculator contingent on the power-sizing model. 

The calculator asks the user to select from a list of common industrial sets of equipment such as a compressor, motor, and a reactor. 
Subsequently, the user is asked to input the new and old capacity (whether it be volume, area, or any other type of dimension) and then the cost of the old equipment. 

Ultimately, based on the inputted information, the calculator will output the cost of the new sized equipment.
